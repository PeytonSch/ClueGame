How we selected our test cells:

For FourDoorDirectionsTest we selected the cells at (4,0), (6,4), (3,3), and
(22,6), . These cells represent doorways with directions
down, up, right, and left respectively. We then chose cells 
(20,8), and (13,5) which are both not doorways to ensure that we were
reading in doorways correctly.Furthermore, we chose these cells in so that
they belong to different rooms to make sure our tests covered different areas
of our board.
